## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:
- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react]
